    Loads Florida election results.

    Florida results are provided in tab-delimited text files.
    
    A description of fields is available at 
    https://doe.dos.state.fl.us/elections/resultsarchive/downloadresults.asp?ElectionDate=11/6/2012

    Notes:

    Some elections appear to have multiple rows representing the same data
    e.g. ``20120814__fl__primary.tsv``. 

    Results with an ``OfficeDesc`` value of "U.S. President by Congressional
    District" are by county and congressional district.  The county is in
    the ``CountyName`` field and the district is in the ``Jurs1num`` field.

    The ``CanNameMiddle`` field also includes nicknames, but not in a standard
    format.  Examples include "Anne 'Libby'" and "(Doc)".

    Name suffixes are in the ``CanNameLast`` field, e.g. "Braynon,, II"

    Write-in candidates are identified by a value of "Write-In" in the 
    ``PartyName`` field.

    "No Party Affiliation" is also a possibility.  This is different than
    "Independent Party".

    Some contests force the last names of the governor and lieutenant
    governor into the ``CanNameLast`` and ``CanNameFirst`` fields.
    For these records, the value of ``CanNameMiddle`` is '/'.
