"""

Illinois' election results portal is
http://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionInformation/DownloadVoteTotals.aspx 

This page offers results at the county level and contain all races
in a single file.

Special election results can be retrieved starting at
http://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionInformation/GetVoteTotals.aspx.

These are available on a per-contest basis.

County results are available, but uses ASP.NET's postback feature to toggle
the county results.
http://www.evagoras.com/2011/02/10/how-postback-works-in-asp-net/
provides a good explanation of how this feature works.

The ``direct_links`` fields from the API appear to point to the correct
starting point for the postback.
